<p>Super engineer with a knack for unraveling problems and a heart that beats for automation. Initiated into the coding realm by a tech-savvy cousin, my engineering roots run deep, and my obsession for problem-solving has known no bounds. I love working at startups where my impact can be shown quickly, but I also don't mind big tech. </p>
